#You are a part of a pirate ship that survives by looting islands. Your crew has the
#responsibility of devising a plan to efficiently rob the islands where each island is divided
#into smaller land parts due to the river flowing through it. Each land part is joined to another
#land part by a bridge. (i.e. one land part can be directly connected to another land part by
#using almost 1 bridge). After thorough discussion, the crew came to a conclusion that the
#only way to carry out the loot successfully is to loot only those islands in which all the
#bridges are covered only once. Given the topology of the island, your job is to analyze the
#island and tell whether the pirates should loot the given island or not.

#INPUT:
#The first line of the input asks for the ‘Number of Islands’
#Second line asks for the number of land parts (nodes)
#And based on the number of land parts (nodes) each subsequent line gives the details
#about the number of degrees of those land parts

#OUTPUT:
#"island can be looted" or "island cannot be looted"

#SAMPLE INPUT :
##1 - 2
##2 - 3
##3 - 2 2 3
##4 - 2 1 3
##5 - 2 1 2
##6 - 1
##7 - 0

##1 denotes the ‘number of islands’
##2 denotes the ‘ number of land parts/nodes'
##3 first digit, in this case ‘2’ denotes the degrees of the ‘first’ land part and following digits,
#‘2’ & ‘3’ denote the land parts, first land part is connected to
##4 first digit, in this case ‘2’ denotes the degrees of the ‘second’ land part and following
#digits, ‘1’ & ‘3’ denote the land parts, second land part is connected to
##5 first digit, in this case ‘2’ denotes the degrees of the ‘second’ land part and following
#digits, ‘1’ & ‘2’ denote the land parts, third land part is connected to
##6 is the number of land parts for the second island because we chose ‘2’ as an input in #1
##7 in this case, second island has only one land part/node therefore it’s degree can’t be
#more than (degree-1) i.e. ‘0’.

#SAMPLE OUTPUT:
#"island can be looted"
